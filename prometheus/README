Build the image with:

`bazel build :image.tar`
(Notice the .tar - this will ensure an image that can be loaded into Docker).

Load the image into docker with:

`docker load -i ../bazel-bin/prometheus/image.tar`

Run the image and make sure you bind-mount the directory containing the prometheus.yml file into /config:
`docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/config -v some_dir:/data -p9090:9090 bazel/prometheus:image`
